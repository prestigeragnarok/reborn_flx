	On January 28, 2020 at 1:00 AM (Server Time - GMT+8), we will be conducting a server maintenance which will require a complete server shut down in order to safely perform and implement updates and fixes to the server files. Below are few of the updates included in this scheduled maintenance.
 


	 
 


	
		LHZ Card Revamp
	
	
		New Item Release
	
	
		New Costumes
	
	
		New NPC Feature
	
	
		Quality of Life Improvements
	
	
		Bug Fixes
	



	 
 


	The server's engines will be shut down for about 3-6 hours which includes both implementation and testing. We urge you to log off beforehand to avoid account related issues and make all the necessary preparations. For guild leaders, we advise you to check your castles and break your treasure boxes beforehand to avoid any spawn issues. We have assigned C-3PO to assist in creating the patch notes and I will be posting his list as soon as the server is back up and self-sustaining.

	Tonight, January 19, 2020 at 11:00 PM (Server Time - GMT+8), we will be conducting a server maintenance which will require a complete server shut down in order to safely migrate the files over to the newly purchased host located in Singapore.
 


	 
 


	The server will be shut down for about 2-4 hours which includes both moving the files and testing the live server. We urge you to log off beforehand to avoid account related issues and make all the necessary preparations. Unfortunately, tomorrow's castle drops which spawns at 12:00 AM will not spawn automatically but announcements will be made if we are able to do that manually.
